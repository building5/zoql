# zoql changelog

## v1.0.3 (2018-06-25)

 * Okay; maybe last time on `--describe`. Really ought to add unit tests...

## v1.0.2 (2018-06-25)

 * Really correct `--describe`. Removed `explicitArray: false` from XML parsing
   so I could have consistent, if annoying, parsed versions of the describe
   response.

## v1.0.1 (2018-06-25)

 * Correct `--describe` when related objects is a single object.

## v1.0.0 (2018-06-11)

 * Initial release
